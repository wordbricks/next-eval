# NEXT-EVAL: From Web URLs to Structured Tables – Extraction and Evaluation

Welcome to **NEXT-EVAL**, a comprehensive toolkit for the rigorous evaluation and comparison of methods for extracting **tabular data records** from web pages. This framework supports both traditional algorithms and modern Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches. We provide the necessary components to generate datasets, preprocess web data, evaluate model performance, and conduct standardized benchmarking.


**NEXT-EVAL** is an open-source library accompanying the NeurIPS 2025 paper:

This library provides tools for generating web-to-table datasets, applying extraction techniques (both traditional and LLM-based), and evaluating them with a standardized framework. It is intended to advance benchmarking and reproducibility in web data extraction research.

## 🔧 Components

### 1. Dataset Generation Tool

Convert real-world webpages into structured datasets using the following tools:

* **MHTML Downloader**: Save complete webpages as `.mhtml` archives.
* **HTML to Slim HTML**: Clean and simplify raw HTML for readability and model input.
* **HTML to JSON Converter**: Annotate and structure webpage content into a consistent JSON format for table extraction and supervision.

### 2. Table Generation Tool

Generate tabular data from web content using:

* **Traditional MDR Algorithms**: Integrate existing Model-based Data Record (MDR) extractors to produce tables from HTML.
* **LLM-based Extraction**: Run large language models to extract tabular data from raw or simplified HTML inputs.

### 3. Evaluation Framework

Measure and compare the performance of different extraction methods:

* **Scoring Engine**: Compute precision, recall, and F1 scores on both cell-level and schema-level.
* **Evaluation Scripts**: Ready-to-run scripts to benchmark traditional and LLM extractors on your dataset.

### 4. Data

Get started with:

* ✅ **Sample MHTML Files**: A curated set of real-world webpages.
* ✅ **Sample Annotations**: Human-verified ground truth tables in JSON.

### 5. Benchmark Suite

Includes standardized datasets and evaluation results for:

* Traditional MDR algorithms
* LLM-based extractors (e.g., gemini-2.5-preview)
* Hybrid pipelines

This enables reproducible comparisons across techniques and tasks, such as:

* Web product listings
* Event calendars
* Job listings, etc.
